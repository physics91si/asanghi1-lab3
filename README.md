Part1:
    - Good job overall. This part seems to be working as expected.
    - One small note is that your code code have been simpler by either using 1 for loop instead of multiple ones, or by using a function called strip. The way strip works is "string.strip(":!?.-'\",;&()[]{}")". This essentially would remove all of the characters in the parenthesis from the string.

Part2:
    - The code overall is in a clean form, great job.
    - The goal here was to get you going with some python arithmetic and calculation. Still, it's great that you found an easier way by importing a library
    - Usually when you import you are suggested to put the import statement in the top of the file.
    
Part3:
    - Very clean way of showing the results. Using a dictionary is definitely a very good thing.
